Hi! I'm Andrew, also known as Mirrexagon. I'm a Software Engineering student hailing from Australia.

I love programming, and my favourite language is Lua. Check out [my GitHub](https://github.com/{{ site.github_username }})!

I also sometimes make music, usually in the style of demoscene music. Take a look at the [music section]({{ site.baseurl }}/music/)!

I have been known to occasionally write fiction, and do vector and 3D art. I don't really have any skill in sketching though.

This is my personal website, built with Jekyll. Currently it only serves as a repository for my music, but I'll probably expand it in the future. Right now, it's basically the default Jekyll site with some modifications. Source is [here](https://github.com/{{ site.github_username }}/{{ site.github_username }}.github.io).

Logo made with [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/). It's literally just "Mirrexagon" in the [Altera 6](http://www.dafont.com/altera2.font) font, except the "o" is replaced with a hexagon.
