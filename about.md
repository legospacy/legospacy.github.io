Hi! I'm Andrew, also known as Mirrexagon. I'm a Software Engineering student hailing from Australia.

I love programming, and my favourite language is Lua.

I also sometimes write music, and I have been occasionally known to write fiction and do vector and 3D art.

This is my personal website. Currently it only serves as a repository for my music, but I'll probably expand it in the future.

Logo made with [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/). It's literally just "Mirrexagon" in the [Altera 6](http://www.dafont.com/altera2.font) font with the "o" replaced with a hexagon.
