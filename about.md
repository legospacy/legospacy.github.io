Hi! I'm Andrew, also known as Mirrexagon. I'm a Software Engineering student hailing from Australia.

I love programming, and my favourite languages are [Lua](https://www.lua.org/) and [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/). Check out [my GitHub profile](https://github.com/{{ site.github_username }})!

I also sometimes make music, under the name LMirx. You can find it on [lmirx.net](https://lmirx.net).

This is my personal website, built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). Right now, it's basically the default Jekyll site with some modifications. Source is [here](https://github.com/{{ site.github_username }}/{{ site.github_username }}.github.io).

Logo made with [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/). It's literally just "Mirrexagon" in the [Altera 6](http://www.dafont.com/altera2.font) font, except the "o" is replaced with a hexagon.
