    describes it perfectly. I accidentally made the ending somewhat unsatisfying,
    so be prepared to want to listen to this over and over forever.

  comment: 'Now this, this is a big one.


    This song started off as a chiptune, written as though for a demoscene demo. I
    got up to where the chiptune ends, and ran out of ideas.


    It lay around in my WIP folder for quite a while. Then one day I went back to
    it and thought, "Wouldn''t this be awesome as a kind of mashup of chiptune, electro
    and acoustic instruments?" This is the result!


    If you do take a look at the source file in SunVox, behold the giant module graph
    in all its glory!
