  comment: I felt like playing with a piano instrument for this one. It's a bit short,
    maybe too short, but I still think it works. The hardest part was getting all
    the volumes balanced (I'm still not convinced that they are, but oh well).

  comment: 'Now this, this is a big one.


    This song started off as a chiptune, written as though for a demoscene demo. I
    got up to where the chiptune ends, and ran out of ideas.


    It lay around in my WIP folder for quite a while. Then one day I went back to
    it and thought, "Wouldn''t this be awesome as a kind of mashup of chiptune, electro
    and acoustic instruments?" This is the result!


    If you do take a look at the source file in SunVox, behold the giant module graph
    in all its glory!
